# Projects
Thank you for taking the time to review my projects. Over the past few months, I have been refining my skills in preparation for entering the workforce and have confidence with different languages and frameworks. The projects are organized by programming language, allowing for quick understanding of the languages in which I am proficient.

My name is Ryan Hanner, and I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the University of South Florida. I come from a small town just north of Tampa where I have done nothing much but worked, whether it was fixing dirt bikes, four wheelers or working the rodeos I was always doing something to make a buck. Since a child, I had always had a love for video games for here. My passion for game development eventually led me to explore programming, which has brought me to where I am today.
