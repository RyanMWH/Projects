# Snake Game
This game tended to be a little more intricate to work with I had to learn how to hold the sections of the snake in some sort of collection such as a list or an array. I never fully finished this either as for time, but I was planning on looking to make the collision in a two player version where the snakes uses Objection Orientation to work as there own and play against each other. I plan to get back to this during Winter break and continue adding to my portfolio.
