# Pygame
These are little games I made on Python using the pygame library, I also learned to use time, system & a couple other normal libraries. I also tried to focus on using classes as much as I possibly can because at one point they were not my strong suit. But after the first two of the games here I figured it. I eventually plan to come back to this if I haven't already to change the layout, backgrounds, skins, and sounds. Most of these are free use and random ideas I used across the web. I will eventually be making a folder for these to live in where it will store data from previous games like high scroes, etc. Also most of these games have no coordination when it comes to separating out the data they are just continuous lines of code in one file, which will change if not already. The reason some of multiple files is because I tried to break it up so I could have an understanding have what I did last time, I would've used the Github through VS Code, but it can be glitchy for me with my internet at times.
